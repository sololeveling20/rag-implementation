RAG based document question answering system using Google Colab

## Overview
This project implements a Naive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based
document-aware question answering system using Google Colab.

The system retrieves relevant information from a small set of PDF documents
and generates grounded answers using a language model.

## Features
- PDF document ingestion
- Text chunking and embeddings
- Vector database for retrieval
- Similarity-based document search
- Grounded answer generation
- Reduced hallucinations

## Dataset
The knowledge base consists of two curated PDF documents used to demonstrate
the RAG pipeline clearly and effectively.

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook using the **Open in Colab** button.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Upload the PDF documents.
4. Enter a question in the input cell to get an answer.

## Note
If GitHub preview shows "Invalid Notebook", please open the notebook using
the **Open in Colab** button.

## Future Scope
- Add conversational memory
- Improve UI
- Support more documents
- Deploy as a web application
